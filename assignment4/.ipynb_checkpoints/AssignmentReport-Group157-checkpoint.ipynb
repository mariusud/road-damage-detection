    "\n",
    "Objects can have wildly varying shapes, as cars will often be more rectangular, and e.g. a football will have a squared bounding box. To get a bigger IoU between prediction and gt_box, the SSD will predict a number of objects with varying shapes at the same spatial location. The team behind SSD discovered that the model will fight between the different aspect ratios thus leaving the predictions unstable. To counter this, they start guesses based on \"default\" boxes that are preselected manually and carefully.\n",
